Ya see i wake up every morning, tie my sneakers,
Walk down the block, do exactly as the beat does, bop to it,
Pop and lock to it, fuck it up, rock to it,
Bring that feeling back of soul in the track,
To those summers in the city when it's hot on the block,
Music so loud it's drowning out your voice when you talk,
To those winters in the city when it's brick ass cold,
Steam is rising off your dome when you projecting them flows,
Still outside, feel that vibe it's so complete,
Experience and memories that make us unique,
And how you translate em, abstract and verbatim,
Life's the only option when death's the ultimatum.
So what you want a light sabre or a Garcia Vega,
Ascending to your heights or wasting all your light tonight,
Get out your crib and help the people unite or
Just lively up yourself and do some shit that you like.
Step outside no matter if you're chilling or you fly,
Lets take the train or the bus or whip and glide,
It's a beautiful day no need to stay inside,
Cos everybody likes a joy ride.
Step outside no matter if you're chilling or you fly,

Mic check yep yep yo,
Ain't no telling where we going where we zoning,
Maybe even take it back to times of ancient Roman,
Or write a thought like a Jigabot into the future,
So inspired we could try out all of these manoeuvres,
As the scenery floats by the buildings look so fly,
You better give him back his toy or else that kid gon' cry.
Mothers and sons, everyone from old to young,
The spectrum of life, the city shown in decadent lights.
The nightfall is a mysterious thing,
I would say the moon illuminates the spirits within, the city of sin,
You feeling comfortable in your skin?
Everybody gather round and let the madness begin.
My assessment was smoke and
Refreshments, antidepressants and harsh life lessons.
I think we all can see the stars above the
Sorrow, let's meet again and do this shit tomorrow.
