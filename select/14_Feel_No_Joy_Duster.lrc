[00:44.50] How small and sad this life is
[01:03.97] These tiny restless thoughts
[01:14.73] Time came and went
[01:23.73] 
[01:27.46] One candle lights one more
[01:38.92] We're stuck here wandering
[01:51.92] 
[02:01.75] Lighter than death, oh go on then
[02:21.05] I wonder where they went
[02:33.05] 
[02:32.48] Spread light, feel no joy
[02:44.47] Sick color and sick sound
[02:56.27] Wait for sick to change shape
[03:06.28] All fucked up and broken
