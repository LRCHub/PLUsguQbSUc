I used to sing to an empty room

I was so lonely and so out of tune
You came along and
Made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel your love
Never set me free
Cause darlin'
I can't be without you
Without you baby

I used to go to a show all alone
I'd sit through it twice
I just couldn't go home
Then you came along
And made my life a happy song

It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel your love
Never set me free
Cause darlin' I can't be without you
Without you baby

Then you came along
And, made my life a happy song
It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy to feel you love
Never set me free, cause darlin
I can't be without you
It's a joy to have you love
Never set me free, cause darlin
I can't be without you
Without ya baby

Then you came along
And, made my life a happy home
It's a joy to have your love
Such a joy feel your love
It's a joy to see ya
It's a joy have your love
Ohhh, I feel so good
Havin you around
Such a joy to see ya love
It's a joy have your love
Such a joy to feel ya
