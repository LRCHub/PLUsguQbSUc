Oh joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing

And I drove across the desert
I was in my four wheel drive
I was looking for the Buddha
And I saw Jesus Christ

He smiled and shrugged his shoulders
And lit a cigarette
Said, "Jump for joy, make some noise
Remember what I said." Oh yeah

My soul is a like a ruby
And I threw it in the earth
But now my hands are bleeding
From scrabbling in the dirt

And I looked up to the heavens
And a light is on my face
I never never never
Thought I'd find a state of grace

Hey joy, love you bring
Oh joy, make my heart sing
Oh joy, joy in everything

Joy, joy, joy, oh joy
Joy, joy, joy, oh joy

I was drowning in the darkness
As I drove down to the sea
Joy, joy, joy, oh joy

And I looked up to the mountain
And the light burst over me
Joy, joy, joy, oh, oh joy
You make me sing, yeah

Oh joy, the love you bring
Oh joy, you make me sing
Oh joy, in everything
In everything, everything

Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy

Jump for joy
Jump for joy
Jump for joy

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ah
